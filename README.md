# Real Estate Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of real estate data to identify market trends, factors affecting property prices, and provide data-driven insights for decision-making. The project covers data cleaning, hypothesis testing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization using Python and Tableau.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy
- **Tableau**: Interactive data visualizations and dashboards
- **Hypothesis Testing**: t-tests, ANOVA for analyzing factors affecting property prices
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Handling missing values, standardizing formats, and feature engineering

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: The real estate dataset was loaded into Python using pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Missing values were handled, data types were standardized, and features were engineered for further analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted a detailed analysis to identify trends, correlations, and patterns in property prices, location, and other factors.
4. **Hypothesis Testing**: Applied statistical tests like t-tests and ANOVA to examine the impact of variables like property type, location, and size on property prices.
5. **Data Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards and visualizations using Tableau to communicate insights clearly and effectively.
6. **Reporting**: Presented key findings and recommendations in a concise, actionable format for stakeholders.

## Key Insights

- Identified key factors such as location, square footage, and property type that significantly affect real estate prices.
- Validated assumptions about the real estate market using hypothesis testing.
- Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard that allows users to explore trends in property prices and make data-driven decisions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Load the dataset and run the provided Jupyter notebooks for data cleaning and analysis.

4.View the Tableau dashboard for interactive visualizations and insights.
